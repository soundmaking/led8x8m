# led8x8m

Playing with an 8x8 LED matrix module via Python and GPIO on Raspberry Pi.

Info at [fixme link] includes a data sheet pdf link and a link to Arduino Library for control of the matrix.  

To use with the GPIO on a Raspberry Pi, programming in Python, the page at [fixme link] has an illustrated guide with a code listing that was found to work (afteri fixing some white-space indentations).  The LED matrix module pictured in that guide is slightly different to the one being sold by Pimoroni, but the 16 pins seems to work the same.

_**Note:** the guide on circuitdigest.com has a capacitor (connected across power supply) - I have not been using this._
